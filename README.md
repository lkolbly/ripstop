# Ripstop Programming Language

This is the source code repository for Ripstop, a ⚠️highly experimental⚠️ hardware description language (a more modern alternative for Verilog or VHDL).

In fact, this language is so experimental right now, that you shouldn't even try using it. It's too early even for early adopters. Check back in early 2023 - we'll have some cool stuff for you then!
