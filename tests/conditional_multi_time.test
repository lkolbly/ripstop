### CODE

module mux(bit a, bit b, bit sel) -> (bit c) {
    if sel[t-1] {
       c[t] = b[t-1];
    } else {
       c[t-1] = a[t-1];
    }
}

### OUTPUT
Variables must be assigned at the same time offset in both branches of a conditional
First assignment at line 4 col 15:
       c[t] = b[t-1];
              ^
Second assignment at line 6 col 17:
       c[t-1] = a[t-1];
                ^
